# Comparative Analysis of the Classification Algorithms 

This project represents a detailed analysis and application results of various classification algorithms implemented in the MATLAB software package and applied to the `carbig.mat` dataset, done for the purposes of obtaining extra points in the **Random processes in telecommunications (19E033SPT)** class. 

The goal of this project is to investigate the possibility of classifying cars by country origin based on their characteristics such as engine volume (Displacement), horse power (Horsepower), weight (Weight) and acceleration (Acceleration). using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) and Na√Øve Bayes classification algorithms
